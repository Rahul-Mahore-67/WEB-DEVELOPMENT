    <h1>Welcome!</h1>
    <p style="color: blue; font-size: 16px;">This text has inline styles.Characteristics and Use Cases:
High Specificity: Inline styles have the highest specificity among CSS styling methods, overriding styles defined in external stylesheets or internal style tags.
Limited Reusability: Styles defined inline are specific to a single element and are not easily reusable across multiple elements.
Quick Application: Ideal for applying unique, one-off styles to individual elements without affecting global styles.
Testing and Debugging: Useful for quickly testing or previewing style changes during development.
Email Templates: Often used in email templates to ensure consistent styling across various email clients, which may have limited support for external or internal stylesheets.
Drawbacks:
Maintenance Challenges: Modifying styles requires editing each individual element, which can be cumbersome for large projects or frequent changes.
Code Clutter: Mixing CSS directly within HTML can make the HTML code less readable and harder to maintain.
Against Best Practices: Generally, it is advised to separate content (HTML) from presentation (CSS) for better organization and maintainability. External or internal stylesheets are preferred for most styling needs.</p>
