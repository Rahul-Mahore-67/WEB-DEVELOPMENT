        <p>The CSS Box Model is a fundamental concept in CSS that describes how elements are rendered and how their dimensions are calculated on a webpage. It treats every HTML element as a rectangular box, composed of four distinct layers:
Content: This is the innermost area where the actual content of the element resides, such as text, images, or other media. Its dimensions are defined by the width and height CSS properties.
Padding: This is the transparent space that surrounds the content area, acting as a buffer between the content and the element's border. Padding can be controlled using the padding property and its individual side properties (e.g., padding-top, padding-left).
Border: This is a visible line that encloses the content and padding areas. It provides a visual boundary for the element and can be styled using various border properties (e.g., border-width, border-style, border-color).
Margin: This is the transparent space outside the border, creating separation between the element and other adjacent elements on the page. Margins are controlled by the margin property and its individual side properties (e.g., margin-bottom, margin-right).
Standard Box Model vs. Alternate Box Model:
By default, browsers use the Standard Box Model. In this model, the width and height properties define the dimensions of the content area only. Any padding and border added to the element will increase its total calculated width and height.
The Alternate Box Model, enabled by the box-sizing: border-box; CSS property, changes this behavior. In this model, the width and height properties define the total dimensions of the element, including padding and border. The content area shrinks to accommodate the padding and border within the specified width and height. This often leads to more intuitive and predictable layout behavior.</p>
